# Data Structures and Algorithm programs in C for SECOND Semester
This repository contains the C programs that I have submitted for assignments and records during my first semester at college, focusing on the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. The programs cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting and searching algorithms, and more. Through these programs, I gained a solid understanding of data structure and algorithm design, implementation, and optimization using the C programming language.

## Structure of the Repository
[`ListUsingArrays.c`](https://github.com/fromjyce/DSA-in-C/blob/main/ListUsingArrays.c) - Demonstrates the Array Implementaion of List ADT

[`ListUsingPointers.c`](https://github.com/fromjyce/DSA-in-C/blob/main/ListUsingPointers.c) - Demonstrates the Pointer Based Implementaion of LIST ADT
## Running the Programs
To run the C programs, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The programs have been tested on the GNU GCC compiler on Linux

To compile a program, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
```
To execute the program, run the following command:
```
./program_name
```
## Contact
