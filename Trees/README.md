# TREES
* A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hiearchically.
* A tree is defined as a set of **nodes** storing elements such that the nodes have a **parent-child** relationship.
* If a tree is non empty, it has a special node, called the **root** of the tree, that has no parent.
* Each node of tree different from the root has a unique **parent** node.
* Every node with parent is a **child** of that parent.
* Two nodes that are children of the same parent are **siblings**.
* A node is **external** if that node has no childrem. They are also known as **leaves**.
* A node is **internal** if it has one or more children.
