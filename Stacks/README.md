# STACKS
* A stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements are done at only one end, 
which is known as the top of the stack.
* Stack is called a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure because 
the last element which is added to the stack is the first element which is deleted from the stack.
* In the computerâ€™s memory, stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions
### Polish Notations
Infix, postfix, and prefix notations are three different but equivalent notations of writing algebraic 
expressions.

### Infix Notation
While writing an arithmetic expression using infix notation, the operator is placed in between 
the operands.

For example, `A+B;`,here, plus operator is placed between the two operands
`A` and `B`.

### Postfix Notation
While writing an arithmetic expression using postfix notation, the operator is placed after the operands.

For example, `AB+;`,here, plus operator is placed after the two operands
`A` and `B`.

### Prefix Notation
While writing an arithmetic expression using prefix notation, the operator is placed before the operands.

For example, `+AB;`,here, plus operator is placed before the two operands
`A` and `B`.
