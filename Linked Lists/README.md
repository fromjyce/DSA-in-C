# LINKED LISTS
A linked list is a very flexible, dynamic data structure in which elements (called nodes) form a 
sequential list.

In a linked list, each node is allocated space as it is added to the list. Every node in the list 
points to the next node in the list.
### Every node contains the following two types of data:
* The value of the node or any other data that corresponds to that node
* A pointer or link to the next node in the list

The last node in the list contains a NULL pointer to indicate that it is the end or tail of the list.
